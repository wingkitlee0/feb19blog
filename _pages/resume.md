### Open Source Contributions  
*2018 -- present*  

**[scikits.bvp_solver](https://github.com/wingkitlee0/scikits.bvp_solver)**  
- A Python library for solving two-point boundary value problems, based on a well-known Fortran library.
- Technologies: Fortran, f2py, setuptools

**[scikit-cuda](https://scikit-cuda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** 
- A Python wrapper for the [MAGMA](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/) GPU linear algebra library, which allows **drop-in** replacement of scipy. 
- Technologies: cuda, cusolver, blas, lapack

### [Arxiv Reader (Mobile)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/arxiv-reader/9nblggh5kb5j)
*2016*
