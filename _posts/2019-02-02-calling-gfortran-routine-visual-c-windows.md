In case you have to use some Fortran libraries on Windows (don't ask why..), there are a few *free* options:

1. Bash on Ubuntu on Windows
2. MING-W64 + Visual Studio
3. Cygwin environment
4. PGI Fortran Compiler in their free community version

This post is about option 2. However, option 1 is obviously the most portable way..

Anyway, here I describe how to call Fortran code from C++ using Visual Studio. I will be focusing on MinGW gfortran as that is a popular free Fortran compiler on Windows platform.

System Requirements:
- Visual Studio 2015 (C++) (I am using the free community version)
- MinGW gfortran (64bit, using the one from Msys here)


My Fortran code is just a simple function in a module (`testfor.f90`):
```fortran
module testfor
    use, intrinsic :: iso_c_binding
    implicit none
contains
    subroutine testingfor(x) bind(c, name="testingfor")
        implicit none
        double precision, intent(in) :: x
 
        print *, "# calling testfor in Fortran!!"
        print *, "x = ", x 
    end subroutine
end module testfor
```

Note that I am using Fortran 2003 standard **iso_c_binding**, which is a standardized way for C/Fortran interface. The `bind` syntax allow you to customize the function name to be called in C++. Here I use the same name `testingfor`. If you are using the old (pre-2003) style, the naming convention for a function in a module may be a little complicated. The new version helps us clean up the code a little. 

Next, my C++ main function is very simple as well (`main.cpp`):
```C
extern "C" {
    void testingfor(double* x);
}
 
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    double y = 1.0;
 
    testingfor(&y);
}
```

The `extern C` syntax acts as an interface. Note that the input argument for the Fortran function must be a **pointer** as Fortran is pass-by-reference only.

The main dish: In Windows, we need the "import" library (`.lib`) and the dynamic library (`.dll`). To generate these files from our fortran code, we need to the following steps (in the Windows' `command prompt`):

```bash
gfortran -c testfor.f90
 
dllwrap.exe --export-all-symbols testfor.o -lgfortran --output-def testfor.def -o testfor.dll

lib.exe /machine:x64 /def:testfor.def
```

First command is simply compiling our Fortran module into an **object** file (`testfor.o`). Second command creates a definition file (`.def`) and a dll file (`.dll`). The `dllwrap.exe` comes with MinGW as for as I know. We may ignore the following error:
```
dllwrap.exe: no export definition file provided.
Creating one, but that may not be what you want
```
The last line with `lib.exe` in the previous code block is to create the import *lib* file with the *def* file. Now we have what we want:  `testfor.lib` and `testfor.dll`.

The final step is to setup the Visual Studio to include the Fortran library files. I donâ€™t go over the details here. In simple words, we need to add `testfor.lib` to the resource folder and let VS know you need it to compile. This can be done by adding `testfor.lib` into `Project-> Properties-> Configuration Properties-> Linker-> Input-> Additional Dependencies`. Note that the resultant `exe` file does require the dynamic library `testfor.dll` in the `PATH` in order to run. Here is the result:

![Command Prompt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/fortranwindows.png){: .align-center}



Hopefully this is useful.
